# ld44

[Ludum Dare 44](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44) attempt.

I'm starting out from a trimmed down version of my latest entry [LD41](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/ld41-raceman).

I have some loose ideas already on what to explore in this edition, we'll see if the theme somehow consolidates into something more concrete.
